# SHATTER
Secure Hashing Algorithm To Terminate Exploitative Requests (Block bad queries and domain names based on their SHA3-512 checksums)

SHATTER, or "Secure Hashing Algorithm To Terminate Exploitative Requests," is a tool designed to enhance your online safety by blocking harmful and malicious content. Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques, SHATTER can identify and block access to websites and online resources that may contain scams, malware, or personal information misuse.

Blocking Illegal or Exploitative Content: A standout feature of SHATTER is its ability to block access to illegal or exploitative content, including illegal pornography. By recognizing the unique digital fingerprints (checksums) of such content, it helps you avoid inadvertently accessing or supporting harmful or unlawful material.

Irreversible Checksums: SHATTER uses cryptographic hash functions to create checksums, which are unique and irreversible mathematical representations of digital data. These checksums cannot be reversed to obtain the original content, ensuring that SHATTER itself cannot inadvertently enable or promote criminal activity. It's a secure way of identifying and blocking unwanted content without compromising your privacy or legal standing.

How Does It Work?: You, the user, can provide SHATTER with lists of domain names and search queries you want to block. These lists can be created by you or obtained from reputable sources, focusing on known harmful or illegal content. Once the lists are linked to SHATTER, the tool uses them to recognize and block the specified sites and searches.

Creating Compatible Blocklists: To create a compatible blocklist for domain names and search queries, you'll need to generate SHA-3 checksums of the specific domain names or queries you want to block. This can be done using a variety of hash calculation tools available online. Each domain name or query should be hashed separately, and the resulting checksums can be stored in a text file. Each line in the text file will represent a checksum of a domain name or search query you want to block.

How to Provide Lists: Simply open the options menu in SHATTER, and you'll find input fields to link to the checksum files for domain names and search queries. Once linked, SHATTER will actively use these lists to filter your browsing experience.

Why Use SHATTER?: By allowing you to customize your own blocking preferences, SHATTER puts control back in your hands. Whether you're aiming to protect yourself from known threats or block specific types of content for personal reasons, SHATTER offers a tailored and secure browsing experience. It's a user-friendly way to personalize your protection and ensure that you're surfing the web with confidence and peace of mind.

Please note that creating and maintaining these blocklists requires careful consideration, and utilizing reputable sources for these lists can help ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
